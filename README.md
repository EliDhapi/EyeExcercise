<h2>Project Title</h2>
Eye Movement Excercise

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project uses javascript, CSS, HTML and is a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. As you hover your mouse over the screen the two ball elements inside the oval elements follow the mouse cursor, mimicking the effect of being followed by a person's eyes.

<h2>How to Run</h2>
(1) Download the following 3 files from this repository into a directory on your local machine: 
<ul>
  <li>mapanimation.js</li>
  <li>styles.css</li>
  <li>index.html</li>
</ul>
(2) Open index.html in your browser.
(3) Move your mouse around the browser window.


<h2>Roadmap of future improvements</h2>
</ul>
 <li>Adding more than two eyes
 <li>The eyes could be made to move in opposite directions, and once they touch the end of the screen, they can rotate
 </ul>
